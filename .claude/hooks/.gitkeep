# Security Hooks
# ==============
#
# Hooks are scripts that protect you from dangerous operations.
# They run BEFORE or AFTER Claude executes commands.
#
# Examples of what hooks can block:
# - Deleting important files (rm -rf)
# - Exposing API keys in output
# - Running destructive database commands
#
# You'll learn about hooks in Module 7: Security Essentials.
# For now, this folder shows you WHERE hooks live.
