# Specs To-Do
# ===========
#
# Planning specs waiting to be implemented go here!
#
# Workflow (you'll learn this in Module 3):
# 1. Create a spec with /plan → saves to specs/todo/
# 2. Build it with /build → reads from specs/todo/
# 3. When complete, move to specs/done/
#
# This folder tracks what NEEDS to be built.
